# Assignment-1

This assignment is intended to first get you acquainted with Open3D, then you will understand and visualize Euler angle representations and gimbal lock. The deadline is 30th August 2020 23:59 hrs.

The ipython notebook (`.ipynb`) is self-sufficient and has all the information you need to get started with the assignment, you don't need any corresponding PDF doc. Just fire up the notebook and get going! 

For setting up conda/virtual env, see `./misc/installation/README.md` for step by step instructions.

A PDF doc has still been uploaded but it serves no other purpose than quick reference. 

For visualization tasks, you don't have to exactly follow the task precisely as given in the notebook: The intent is to illustrate your understanding of a concept (say Gimbal Lock) by just viewing the visualization. As long as you meet that intent, feel free to think beyond what is suggested there and you could come up with a whole new visualization that we hadn't thought of!

### Submission
On Moodle, all you have to submit is this jupyter notebook along with the two given images `color.jpg` and `depth.png`. Every other file (such as `pcd` files) must be generated when I run the notebook with just these two as input. So after you're done collaborating with your group partner on GitHub Classrooms, ensure you don't zip the entire repo but just these 3 files (notebook, `color.jpg`, `depth.jpg`) when you submit to Moodle. 

There will be no deadline extensions. Go through the late policy in the official "Course Information" document.
