    "    * Ans: We have used `np.arctan2` to calculate the inverse tangents of the given values. As opposed to a single-argument inverse tangent function, `np.arctan2` takes in $x$ and $y$ values separately, and uses them to infer the quadrant of the angle, thus being able to output angles in the complete range $[-\\pi, \\pi)$. Single-argument inverse tangents functions lack information about the individual signs of $x$ and $y$ and hence can only return an angle within the *principal-value range* of $[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}).$ Because this would have restricted the output euler angles, this was avoided."

    "    * The major problem with Euler angles is the phenomenon of Gimbal lock. Its cause and consequences are the following.\n",
    "    * **Cause:**\\\n",
    "    Because Euler angles are rotations about moving axes (i.e., while rotating a frame through a sequence of 3 rotations, each subsequent rotation is performed about the axes which are a result of the previous rotation), rotations about *outer* (or higher in the hierarchy) axes affect the *inner* (lower in the hierarchy) axes. This means that a rotation about the $y$ axis affects the $x$ axis, but not the $z$, allowing such a situation when $\\beta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43912285/91614816-dfadc280-e99f-11ea-8612-b9474802ce85.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this image, the $y$ (blue) axis has rotated by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, causing the $x$ (red) and $z$ (green) axes to align. Thus rotations about both these axes have the same effect (object rotating about the length of its fuselage, notice the pivots for both these axes). No rotation about a single axis would now allow the object to *yaw*, or turn sideways, causing a loss of a degree of freedom.\n",
    "    * **Consequences:**\\\n",
    "    Firstly, a frame in a gimbal lock loses a degree of freedom. Both the $x$ and $z$ axes now cause the object to roll about the length of its fuselage, and no axis allows it to yaw (turn towards the left or right). While it is always possible to still point it in any direction by using a combination of multiple rotations, the resulting motion would not be straight and smooth (since it has to be about multiple axes), which may be undesirable in applications such as animation.\\\n",
    "    Secondly, the alignment of the $z$ and $x$ axes means that a *yaw* (rotation about $z$) followed by a $\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ *pitch* (rotation about $y$) produces the same result as a $\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ *pitch* followed by a *roll* (rotation about $x$). Thus, Euler angles are not unique anymore, complicating their conversion to and from other representations of rotation.\n",

    "        * Ans: No, we used `'ZYX'`, and not `'zyx'` as the sequence of rotations. The former refers to *intrinsic* rotations, or rotations about moving axes (each rotation in a sequence of 3 rotations is about an axes which was affected by the previous rotation), which are defined as *Euler angles* in the book. `'zyx'`, on the other hand, refers to *extrinsic* rotations, or rotations about fixed axes (all the 3 rotations are about the original set of fixed axes), which are defined as *Fixed angles* in the book. \n",
    "    - Has `scipy` shown any warnings on any of the above cases? If yes, explain it.\n",
    "        * Ans: While finding the Euler angles for $N$, `scipy` shows a warning indicating that it has detected a gimbal lock. Because Euler angles are no longer unique, it sets $\\gamma=0$ (*roll*, or rotation about $x$) and then finds a set of Euler angles to achieve that rotation.\n",
    "    - (Optional) For Case 3 above (quaternion) which you did using scipy, did you observe any problem with quaternion? Depending on your observations, which is better? Quaternion or Euler angles? And why?\n",
    "         * Ans: Quarternions have a clear 2 to 1 mapping with rotation matrices ($q$ and $-q$ represent the same rotations in all cases), and do not suffer from degeneracies such as the gimbal lock. Thus, `scipy` was able to convert $N$ to quarternions and back, just as easily as $M$. Hence, quarternions are better than Euler angles for representing rotations for computations. However, quarternions come from a not-so-intuitive number system and are extremely hard to visualize. This is where Euler angles outperform quarternions.\n"

    "A nice visualization video for gimbal lock is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8b2Jo7mno). You are about to animate a similar visualization demonstrating gimbal lock 😃.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./misc/xyz-frame.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function `two_four` for the visualization of gimbal lock. Follow the below steps to get the intuition going. Use Open3D for the following.\n",
    "    - Say our frame's initial position is as the above image. Now the final goal at the end of rotation is to get the $Y$ axis pointing in the direction of the vector $(x,y,z)$ that you currently see in the above image. This point is fixed in space and is NOT moving as we rotate our axis.\n",
    "    - For creating that point, you could use a small sphere using `open3d.geometry.create_mesh_sphere`. You already know how to create an axis by now.\n",
    "    - Following our $ZYX$ convention, first rotate your frame about $Z$ axis by an angle, say $-35^{\\circ}$. Then rotate about $Y$ axis by an angle ${\\beta}$ and then about $X$ by say $55^{\\circ}$.\n",
    "        - Are there any specific angle(s) $\\beta$ using which you will **never** reach our point $(x,y,z)$ ?\n",
    "            - Clue: We are specifically talking about gimbal lock here and notice the word \"never\".\n",
    "        - Under this (these) specific angle(s) of $\\beta$ & different combinations of $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$, make an animation and clearly show why your $Y$ axis is unable to align in the direction of that vector $(x,y,z)$ using the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "            If you are unsure to simulate the animation, you could do it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - You could first fix some $\\alpha$, say $-35^{\\circ}$ & an above value of $\\beta$, you can now vary $\\gamma$ from $-180^{\\circ} \\text{ to }180^{\\circ}$ to simulate the animation.\n",
    "            - Now fix another $\\alpha$, say $45^{\\circ}$ and repeat the above process. So that's 2 specific values of $\\alpha$.\n",
    "            - Show this for all angles of $\\beta$ if there are more than 1.\n",
    "            - Therefore, when the code is run, there should be a minimum of (2 $\\times$ (number of values of $\\beta$)) animations. 2 for values of $\\alpha$, you could show it for even more if you wish to."
